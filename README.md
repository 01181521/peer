## Encryption

Place the training set folder under the `datasets` folder. The training set folder should contain two folders `trainA` and `trainB`, where `trainA` contains 1000 randomly selected training images and `trainB` contains a set of images encrypted using a common encryption algorithm such as pixel permutation encryption.
